### task-manager.clar
Manages farming tasks and drone assignments.

## Development
1. Install Clarinet
2. Run `clarinet check`
3. Run `clarinet test`

## Security Considerations
- Access control for drone operations
- Task validation
- Coordinate boundary checking
- Maintenance enforcement

## Testing
Minimum 50% test coverage required.
Run tests: `clarinet test`
